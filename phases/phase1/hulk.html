            <h2>ABOUT THE MOVIE</h2>
            <p>The Incredible Hulk is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character the Hulk. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Universal Pictures, it is the second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It was directed
                by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay by Zak Penn, and stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner alongside Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Ty Burrell, and William Hurt. In the film, Bruce Banner becomes the Hulk as an unwitting pawn in
                a military scheme to reinvigorate the "Super-Soldier" program through gamma radiation. Banner goes on the run from the military while attempting to cure himself of the Hulk.</p>

            <li>Edward Norton as Bruce Banner</li>
            <li>Liv Tyler as Betty Ross</li>
            <li>Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky / Abomination</li>

            <li>William Hurt as Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross</li>
            <p>Robert Downey Jr. has an uncredited cameo as Tony Stark at the end of the film. Downey appeared as a favor to Marvel Studios, which he acknowledged as a smart move on Marvel's part, because when he was promoting his film he would also have
                to mention their other production.</p>
