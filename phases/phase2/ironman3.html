            <h2>OVERVIEW OF THE MOVIE</h2>
            <p>Plagued with worry and insomnia since saving New York from destruction, Tony Stark, now, is more dependent on the suits that give him his Iron Man persona -- so much so that every aspect of his life is affected, including his relationship
                with Pepper. After a malevolent enemy known as the Mandarin reduces his personal world to rubble, Tony must rely solely on instinct and ingenuity to avenge his losses and protect the people he loves.
