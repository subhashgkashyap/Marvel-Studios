Hi there...

This project is built using HTML(HyperText Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). The website doesn't has any backend. HTML is used to display the contents on the screen and CSS is used for styling the contents.

All photos used in this project are taken from various sources available from the internet and some are edited as per the requirements. I do not own any media and YouTube links used in this project. The project is purely a fan work and is an UNOFFICIAL website.

This static website will give you the efficient information of the movies that have been released till date under the Marvel Studios/Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU).
